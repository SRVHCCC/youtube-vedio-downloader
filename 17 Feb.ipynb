    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a JSON-like format to store data. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with strict schemas, MongoDB stores data as flexible documents that can have varying structures and fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not rely on the traditional tabular relationships used in relational databases. Non-relational databases are designed to be more flexible, scalable, and capable of handling unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, images, or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for a high degree of scalability, performance, and flexibility in data modeling. Some specific scenarios where MongoDB might be preferred over SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-volume data ingestion: MongoDB can handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data much more efficiently than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex data structures: If you have data with complex or changing structures, MongoDB's flexible document-based data model can make it easier to store and query the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid application development: MongoDB's document-based approach can make it easier to develop and iterate on applications, particularly when working with agile development methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-based or distributed applications: MongoDB's ability to horizontally scale across multiple servers or cloud instances makes it a good choice for applications that need to scale rapidly or have high availability requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB can be a good choice for applications that require high scalability, performance, and flexibility in data modeling. However, it's important to evaluate your specific requirements and compare MongoDB against other database solutions before making a final decision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to work with data and adapt to changes in data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers and clusters, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data schema: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema, so you can add and remove fields as needed without having to modify the entire database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports various indexing options such as single-field indexes, compound indexes, and geospatial indexes, which makes querying and searching data faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB supports replication and automatic failover, which ensures that the database remains available even if one or more servers go down."
